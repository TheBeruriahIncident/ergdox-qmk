To find this repo, look in `~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/ergodox_ez/glow/keymaps/TheBeruriahIncident`
To flash, open QMK MSYS and run `qmk flash -kb zsa/ergodox_ez/m32u4/glow -km TheBeruriahIncident`
I don't totally know what m32u4 is, but I'm guessing it's the microcontroller I have.
This works with the ZSA fork of QMK (firmware 24).
